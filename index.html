					<h1>Welcome to Aaron Samardzich's Web Site </h1>
					<p>
					I am a first-year graduate student in the Master of Science in Technical 
					Communication and Information Design program at the Illinois Institute
					of Technology. <strong><a href="about-me.html">Read more</a></strong>.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					Throughout my undergraduate coursework at DePaul University, I have completed 
					various projects that reflect my professional skills and interests. An aspiring
					technical writer, I plan on expanding my <strong><a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a></strong> 
					to include additonal samples of technical documentation as I complete my graduate coursework, 
					as most of my current portfolio items are academic and research-based.
					</p>

					<h3>New Project at Work (November 11, 2010)</h3>
					
					<p>
					As a technical writing intern at Thomson Reuters in Chicago, I've been working on creating a quick reference guide
					for a financial software application called QA studio, a quantitative analytics engine powered by Palantir. Over the past 
					several months, I've been primarily working on database schema documentation and release notes, so I was pretty excited to 
					start a new and different project. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
					Over the past few weeks, I've been reading supporting documentation, watching demos for 
					operating the application, and creating intial drafts and outlines. Because simliar documentation like quick reference cards
					and training manuals already exist for the application, it has been difficult deciding on what content to include or omit. 
					Users would benefit from a simple guide that would show them the basics for how to use the application, but it has also been a 
					challenge deciding which examples to include and how to best present them.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					I'll be meeting with the project managers in the coming weeks to further discuss the project, but it will be interesting to see 
					how they respond, as the application is still in development and undergoing changes. However, I suspect that I won't be given 
					too much direction for creating the quick reference guide because its scheduled release has yet to be determined. Hopefully
					my current work won't be completely scrapped throughout the development process.
					</p>

					<h3>Future Food (October 28, 2010)</h3>
					
					<p>
					The other day, I saw the show <i> Future Food</i> on the Planet Green Network. It's about the Moto Restaurant in Chicago
					and the unique cooking techniques the chefs use to create bizarre dishes. I've seen a couple episodes where the chefs have made 
					hamburgers out of what cows eat, and peanut butter out of peanut shells. The video to the right gives an overview of what 
					the chefs do at Moto, but one episode of <i> Future Food</i> that I found particularly interesting had to do with this thing called 
					Miracle fruit.
					</p>
				
					<p>
					Miracle Fruit is a berry found in Africa that, when eaten, makes anything sour that you eat taste sweet, and anything bitter 
					that you eat taste savory. What I found particular inspiring, however,was that one of the head chef's of Moto, Omar Cantu, wants 
					to use Miracle Fruit to help solve world hunger. He plans on dropping crates of edible paper strips made of Miracle Fruit to starving 
					countries, hoping that they will be able to eat foods that normally wouldn't eat, like cactus or hay. Cantu stated that as long as 
					something isn't poisonous to the human body, it can be considered food. I think Cantu's idea and all the work that the chef's do at 
					Moto is innovative, motivational, and inspiring for anyone who is involved in the creative process.
