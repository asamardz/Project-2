					<h1>Professional Statement: Illinois Institute of Technology</h1>
					<p>
					What attracts me most to the field of technical communication is the variety of roles—such as designer, interviewer, writer, 
					and researcher—that technical communicators assume in the workplace. Paired with the constant learning of new technology, 
					these multiple roles motivate me to learn about the dynamic field of technical communication. Although I have some education 
					in technical communication, and I am currently employed as a technical writing intern, I strive to learn more about the theories, 
					principles, and best practices of technical communication and information design. I firmly believe that a graduate degree in 
					Technical Communication and Information Design (TCID) from IIT will ground my knowledge of the field and provide me with the 						necessary skills to become a successful technical communicator.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					As a DePaul University undergraduate English major with minors in Professional Writing and Interactive Media, I have combined my 
					interests in writing and technology, while also learning how these subjects can coexist in a professional setting. Through my 
					English major, I have developed my writing skills through a variety of different lenses such as literary analysis, research papers, 
					fiction, creative non-fiction, and poetry. Through my Professional Writing minor, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of 
					workplace writing and how successful workplace documents are written. By learning how to effectively write documents like memorandums, 						proposals, and reports, I have gained a better understanding of the purpose of workplace documents and how they differ from academic writing.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					I have chosen to pursue an Interactive Media minor because I want to learn more about how people interact with old, new, and emerging media. 
					Growing up with the Internet and groundbreaking technology at my fingertips, I have taken for granted the intricacies within human-computer 
					interaction. My interest in incorporating video, animation, and more interactive applications into technical communication has motivated me 
					to learn web design, Adobe Flash, and Flash ActionScript, which are subjects that I will learn during my final academic classes at DePaul. 
					I believe I can take the skills and knowledge I have acquired through my Interactive Media minor and further develop them through the TCID 						program and IIT’s access to state-of-the-art technology. 
					</p>
			
					<p>
					As a constant user of technology, I am intrigued with learning how to make products, devices, and other forms of technology more usable. 
					Through my coursework at DePaul, I have learned about usability testing and evaluation. My major technical writing course project, a 30-page 
					instruction manual, required me to write, edit, format, and restructure the document for a specific user group. In order to make our manual 
					more user-centered, my team and I created and conducted a usability test, then wrote a usability report that discussed our methodology, 
					results, and plans for revision. In my current human-computer interaction course, my major project involves evaluating the usability engineering 
					process to design my own user interface. These projects have not only provided me with a practical understanding of the way content is shaped 
					for different users, but also with the motivation to succeed in graduate study and to extend my knowledge of technical communication and 
					information design. I hope that I can further develop my knowledge and interest in usability testing by collaborating with IIT’s faculty, 
					students, and Usability Testing and Evaluation Center. 
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Since January of 2009, I have been a tutor consultant at DePaul University’s Writing Center. As a tutor consultant, I help students revise their 
					written work through the analysis and discussion of global and sentence-level issues within their text. By collaborating with students, I am able 
					to teach them the writing, editing, and proofreading skills I have acquired as an English major to help them not only improve their written work, 
					but also become better writers. As a tutor consultant, I also have experience working with students across the academic curriculum. Although I 
					specialize in tutoring students in the humanities, I frequently help students with business and scientific assignments, fostering my interest 						in new subject areas. Working at DePaul’s Writing Center has encouraged me to adapt to multiple disciplines and learning types, which will help 
					me develop the numerous skills a successful technical communicator must possess.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					In addition to being a tutor consultant, I have also been employed as a technical writing intern since June of 2009. As a technical writing intern, 
					I primarily reformat, rebrand, and edit database schema documentation, integrating information from the company database and newly released financial 
					software. The largest project I have undertaken, however, has been revising a 130-page user manual for a software application. I spent several weeks 
					altering the document’s appearance and content, while also learning how to operate the application. My internship has given me insight into the lifecycle 
					of technical documentation and how information can be designed for various user groups. I am confident that graduate study at IIT can help me develop 						the skills I have acquired at my internship to become a more well-rounded and knowledgeable technical communicator. 
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Because technical communication includes variety of professions, I have yet to decide which career I would like to pursue in the field. However, after 
					completing my graduate study, I believe earning an entry-level position as a technical writer would allow me to better understand the technical 
					communicator’s multiple roles as an interviewer, designer, researcher, editor, and writer. After working as a junior technical writer for several 
					years, I would then like to become a senior technical writer and work more closely with the usability and design process of technical documentation. 
					As I better understand how technical writers work together, I would eventually like to lead a team of technical writers and partake in publication 
					management. The curriculum of the TCID program and IIT’s state-of-the-art facilities would provide the resources I need to accomplish these goals. 						I believe I can share the knowledge and skills I have acquired through my education and work experience with other students at IIT, while also 
					expanding my knowledge of technical communication by collaborating with IIT’s students and faculty.
