	<h1>About Me</h1>
	
		<p>I am a first-year graduate student in the Master of 
		Science in Technical Communication and Information Design program at the Illinois Institute (IIT)
		of Technology in Chicago, Illinois. At IIT, I am also a graduate assistant currently tutoring
		fellow undergraduate and graduate students in the school's Writing Center. In June 2010, I graduated 
		from DePaul University with a Bachelor of Arts in English with minors in Professional Writing and Interactive
		Media.</p>

		<p>I've always considered writing to be a very important skill and also my strongest strength as a student.
		My interest in technology has motivated me to learn how writing and
		technology can be combined into a single discipline to not only provide
		myself with finalcial stability, but also motivate me to continue writing
		as technology changes. </p>

		<p> Since June 2009, I've been employed as a technical writing intern at Thomson Reuters
		Markets in Chicago's Loop. I primarily edit, update, and reformat old documentation
		for financial software applications. While I think the finaicial software industry is
		interesting, I plan on pursuing a career in another industry like gaming,
		electronics, or education. I'm very interested in incorporating more interactive
		applications, like video, into technical communication. I'm also interested in 
		instructional design and how education will evolve as technology continues
		to change.</p>
